Recommended to enable if you wish to help us improve our products and find bugs / issues with it! Default: false ReadMe: boolean-- Default: true SafeMode: boolean-- Kicks you before Saving, which prevents you from being detected in any game. Default: false ShutdownWhenDone: boolean-- Shuts the game down after saveinstance is finished. Default: false AntiIdle: boolean-- Prevents the 20-minute-Idle Kick. Default: true Anonymous: {boolean | table{ UserId=string, Name=string }}-- RISKY: Cleans the file of any info related to your account like: Name, UserId. This is useful for some games that might store that info in GUIs or other Instances. Might potentially mess up parts of strings that contain characters that match your Name or parts of numbers that match your UserId. Can also be a table with UserId &amp; Name keys. Default: false ShowStatus: boolean-- Default: true Callback: function-- If set, the serialized data will be sent to the callback function instead of to file. Default: false mode: string-- Valid modes: full, optimized, scripts. Change this to invalid mode like &quot;invalid&quot; if you only want ExtraInstances. &quot;optimized&quot; mode is NOT supported with @Object option. Default: &quot;optimized&quot; noscripts: boolean-- Aliases: Decompile. Default: false scriptcache: boolean-- Default: true decomptype: string-- Deprecated. Default: Uses your executor's decompiler, if available. timeout: number-- If the decompilation run time exceeds this value it gets cancelled. Set to -1 to disable timeout (unreliable). Aliases: DecompileTimeout. Default: 10 DecompileJobless: boolean-- Includes already decompiled code in the output. No new scripts are decompiled. Default: false SaveBytecode: boolean-- Includes bytecode in the output. Useful if you wish to be able to decompile it yourself later. Default: false DecompileIgnore: {Instance | Instance.ClassName | [Instance.ClassName]={Instance.Name}}-- Ignores match &amp; it's descendants by default. To Ignore only the instance itself set the value to = false. Examples: &quot;Chat&quot;, - Matches any instance with &quot;Chat&quot; ClassName, Players = {&quot;MyPlayerName&quot;} - Matches &quot;Players&quot; Class AND &quot;MyPlayerName&quot; Name ONLY, workspace - matches Instance by reference, [workspace] = false - matches Instance by reference and only ignores the instance itself and not it's descendants. Default: {TextChatService} IgnoreList: {Instance | Instance.ClassName | [Instance.ClassName]={Instance.Name}}-- Structure is similar to @DecompileIgnore except = false meaning if you ignore one instance it will automatically ignore it's descendants. Default: {CoreGui, CorePackages} ExtraInstances: {Instance }-- If used with any invalid mode (like &quot;invalidmode&quot;) it will only save these instances. Default: {} IgnoreProperties: table-- Ignores properties by Name. Default: {} SaveCacheInterval: number-- The less the value the more often it saves, but that would mean less performance due to constantly saving. Default: 0x1600 * 10 FilePath: string-- Must only contain the name of the file, no file extension. Default: false AvoidFileOverwrite: boolean-- Prevents writing to place file that already exists. Default: true Object: Instance -- If provided, saves as .rbxmx (Model file) instead. If Object is game, it will be saved as a .rbxl file. MUST BE AN INSTANCE REFERENCE, FOR EXAMPLE - game.Workspace. &quot;optimized&quot; mode is NOT supported with this option. If IsModel is set to false then Object specified here will be saved as a place file. Default: false IsModel: boolean-- If Object is specified then sets to true automatically, unless you set it to false. Default: false NilInstances: boolean-- Save instances that aren't Parented (Parented to nil). Default: false NilInstancesFixes: {[Instance.ClassName]=function}-- This can cause some Classes to be fixed even though they might not need the fix (better be safe than sorry though). For example, Bones inherit from Attachment if we dont define them in the NilInstancesFixes then this will catch them anyways. TO AVOID THIS BEHAVIOR USE THIS EXAMPLE: {ClassName_That_Doesnt_Need_Fix = false}. Default: {Animator = function, AdPortal = function, BaseWrap = function, Attachment = function} IgnoreDefaultProperties: boolean-- Ignores default properties during saving. Default: true IgnoreNotArchivable: boolean-- Ignores the Archivable property and saves Non-Archivable instances. Default: true IgnorePropertiesOfNotScriptsOnScriptsMode: boolean-- Ignores property of every instance that is not a script in &quot;scripts&quot; mode. Default: false IgnoreSpecialProperties: boolean-- Prevents calls to gethiddenproperty and uses fallback methods instead. This also helps with crashes. If your file is corrupted after saving, you can try turning this on. Default: false IsolateLocalPlayer: boolean-- Saves Children of LocalPlayer as separate folder and prevents any instance of ClassName Player with .Name identical to LocalPlayer.Name from saving. Default: false IsolateStarterPlayer: boolean-- If enabled, StarterPlayer will be cleared and the saved starter player will be placed into folders. Default: false IsolateLocalPlayerCharacter: boolean-- Saves Children of LocalPlayer.Character as separate folder and prevents any instance of ClassName Player with .Name identical to LocalPlayer.Name from saving. Default: false RemovePlayerCharacters: boolean-- Ignore player characters while saving. (Enables SaveNotCreatable automatically). Default: true SaveNotCreatable: boolean-- Includes non-serializable instances as Folder objects (Name is misleading as this is mostly a fix for certain NilInstances and isn't always related to NotCreatable). Default: false NotCreatableFixes: table&lt;Instance.ClassName&gt;-- {&quot;Player&quot;} is the same as {Player = &quot;Folder&quot;}; Format like {SpawnLocation = &quot;Part&quot;} is only to be used when SpawnLocation inherits from &quot;Part&quot; AND &quot;Part&quot; is Creatable. Default: { &quot;&quot;, &quot;Player&quot;, &quot;PlayerScripts&quot;, &quot;PlayerGui&quot;, &quot;TouchTransmitter&quot; } IsolatePlayers: boolean-- This option does save players, it's just they won't show up in Studio and can only be viewed through the place file code (in text editor). More info at https://github.com/luau/UniversalSynSaveInstance/issues/2. Default: false AlternativeWritefile: boolean-- Splits file content string into segments and writes them using appendfile. This might help with crashes when it starts writing to file. Though there is a risk of appendfile working incorrectly on some executors. Default: true IgnoreDefaultPlayerScripts: boolean-- **RISKY: Ignores Default PlayerScripts like PlayerModule &amp; RbxCharacterSounds. Prevents crashes on certain Executors. Default: true IgnoreSharedStrings: boolean-- RISKY: FIXES CRASHES (TEMPORARY, TESTED ON ROEXEC ONLY). FEEL FREE TO DISABLE THIS TO SEE IF IT WORKS FOR YOU. Default: true SharedStringOverwrite: boolean-- RISKY: if the process is not finished aka crashed then none of the affected values will be available. SharedStrings can also be used for ValueTypes that aren't SharedString, this behavior is not documented anywhere but makes sense (Could create issues though, due to potential ValueType mix-up, only works on certain types which are all base64 encoded so far). Reason: Allows for potential smaller file size (can also be bigger in some cases). Default: false TreatUnionsAsParts: boolean-- RISKY: Converts all UnionOperations to Parts. Useful if your Executor isn't able to save (read) Unions, because otherwise they will be invisible. Default: false (except Solara) } Structure of the main CustomOptions table. Note: Options are case-insensitive, meaning you could type NilInstances option as nilInStaNces and it would still be valid.
